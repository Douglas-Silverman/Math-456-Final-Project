To run the code:

1) Clone Repository
2) Open Repository in text editor that can run Python 3.7
3) In python terminal pip install the following
    a) pip install numpy
    b) pip install pandas
    c) pip install -U scikit-learn
    d) pip install -U matplotlib
4) Run run_me.py         
    a) Graphs for each strategy and sport should be output from the terminal
    b) There should also be printouts of the performance in the terminal

(NOTE: These files take a while to run. You can comment out any of the run_strategies functions in run_me.py main() function. This will allow you to isolate which strategy you would like to see results for.)
